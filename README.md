## Description

I've decided to try and make a clone of a social media platform.

## Tech Used

- Nextjs
- Postres
- Tailwind
- Drizzle ORM
- Clerk
- Shadcn UI

## Notes

I might migrate this from being serverless to having a full backend.
The more I play with this project and expand on features I think should be apart of it, the more and more
I can tel that this projects wants a dedicated backend.

# ToDo

- I want to change the date that appears on posts on the main page to show a time difference, ie: 4 hours ago. I think the detail page of the post can have the exact date.
- Create a search by tag route so users can filter posts down to those.
- user profile route so we can show all posts of that user.
