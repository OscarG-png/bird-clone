## Notes

I might migrate this from being serverless to having a full backend.
The more I play with this project and expand on features I think should be apart of it, the more and more
I can tel that this projects wants a dedicated backend.

# ToDo

- [x]changing post and hashtag relations.
- [x] most posts to their own component that I can use in other places on the page.
- [ ]I want to change the date that appears on posts on the main page to show a time difference, ie: 4 hours ago. I think the detail page of the post can have the exact date.
- [ ]Create a search by tag route so users can filter posts down to those.
- [ ]user profile route so we can show all posts of that user.
- [ ]likes
- [ ]comments
